This is a fork of a "[clojure
contrib](http://dev.clojure.org/display/doc/Clojure+Contrib)" project,
[test.check](https://github.com/clojure/test.check), which tracks upstream as
closely as possible while maintaiing its own additional objectives.  Please see
the README for details, motivation, etc.

Thus, any bugs or enhancements to core functionality very likely should be
reported / submitted upstream.

Contributions around the ClojureScript support of double-check _are_ very
welcome, as are Github issues and pull requests.
