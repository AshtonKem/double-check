# double-check [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/cemerick/double-check.png)](http://travis-ci.org/cemerick/double-check)

__double-check__ is a fork of [@reiddraper](http://github.com/reiddraper)'s
[simple-check](https://github.com/reiddraper/simple-check), a property-based
testing tool inspired by QuickCheck.  The core idea of simple-check (and thus, __double-check__) is that instead of
enumerating expected input and output for unit tests, you write properties about
your function that should hold true for all inputs. This lets you write concise,
powerful tests.

## Why a fork?

While simple-check is dedicated to remaining a Clojure-only API (at least for
now?) __double-check__ is written using
[cljx](http://github.com/keminglabs/cljx), and thus provides an API that is
portable between Clojure and ClojureScript.  _This approach has already
uncovered significant bugs in ClojureScript itself, and can do the same for your
programs._

Please note that this fork:

1. ...always tracks simple-check as closely as possible, with the only divergences
being those necessary to ensure an API portable between Clojure and
ClojureScript.
2. ...is not a rewrite.  The move to cljx yields minimal changes compared to the
simple-check baseline; 100% of the core logic flows from it.  There's nothing
novel here.
3. ...is not hostile in any way to simple-check, @reiddraper, etc.  It exists
solely to make it possible to apply simple-check's testing approach to
ClojureScript libraries and applications, not to supplant or compete with
simple-check.  In particular, the core abstractions and generator/shrinking
implementation defined in simple-check are considered canonical.  If
simple-check eventually provides equivalent functionality for the ClojureScript
side of the house, this project will be shuttered.
4. ...does not make any guarantees about 100% API compatibility with
simple-check, though it is based upon and tracks it.  i.e. you should not expect
to be able to move from simple-check to double-check (or vice versa) in a
Clojure project with no changes.  None are known to be required right now, but
that _may_ change to maximize runtime target portability.

A word on versioning: `[com.cemerick/double-check]` version numbers will track
simple-check version numbers as well, using a suffixed classifier (e.g. 0.1.2
turns into 0.1.2-1) to indicate local changes.  `SNAPSHOT` version numbers will
be the same as simple-check's.

## Installation

### Leiningen

Add this to your `:dependencies`:

```clojure
[com.cemerick/double-check "0.5.4-SNAPSHOT"]
```

...and make sure you add this to your
[cljsbuild](https://github.com/emezeske/lein-cljsbuild) `:compiler` options:

```clojure
:libs [""]
```

(This is temporary workaround will bring in the JavaScript portion of the
[portable random number generator](http://github.com/cemerick/pprng) for your
ClojureScript builds; this will be necessary until
[CLJS-656](http://dev.clojure.org/jira/browse/CLJS-656) is resolved.)

## Examples

Let's say we're testing a sort function. We want want to check that that our
sort function is idempotent, that is, applying sort twice should be
equivalent to applying it once: `(= (sort a) (sort (sort a)))`. Let's write a
quick test to make sure this is the case:

```clojure
(require '[simple-check.core :as sc])
(require '[simple-check.generators :as gen])
(require '[simple-check.properties :as prop])

(def sort-idempotent-prop
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector gen/int)]
    (= (sort v) (sort (sort v)))))

(sc/quick-check 100 sort-idempotent-prop)
;; => {:result true, :num-tests 100, :seed 1382488326530}
```

In prose, this test reads: for all vectors of integers, `v`, sorting `v` is
equal to sorting `v` twice.

What happens if our test fails? __simple-check__ will try and find 'smaller'
input that still fails. This process is called shrinking. Let's see it in
action:

```clojure
(def prop-sorted-first-less-than-last
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/such-that not-empty (gen/vector gen/int))]
    (let [s (sort v)]
      (< (first s) (last s)))))

(sc/quick-check 100 prop-sorted-first-less-than-last)
;; => {:result false, :failing-size 0, :num-tests 1, :fail [[3]],
       :shrunk {:total-nodes-visited 5, :depth 2, :result false,
                :smallest [[0]]}}
```

This test claims that the first element of a sorted vector should be less-than
the last. Of course, this isn't true: the test fails with input `[3]`, which
gets shrunk down to `[0]`, as seen in the output above. As your test functions
require more sophisticated input, shrinking becomes critical to being able
to understand exactly why a random test failed. To see how powerful shrinking
is, let's come up with a contrived example: a function that fails if its
passed a sequence that contains the number 42:

```clojure
(def prop-no-42
  (prop/for-all [v (gen/vector gen/int)]
    (not (some #{42} v))))

(sc/quick-check 100 prop-no-42)
;; => {:result false,
       :failing-size 45,
       :num-tests 46,
       :fail [[10 1 28 40 11 -33 42 -42 39 -13 13 -44 -36 11 27 -42 4 21 -39]],
       :shrunk {:total-nodes-visited 38,
                :depth 18,
                :result false,
                :smallest [[42]]}}
```

We see that the test failed on a rather large vector, as seen in the `:fail`
key. But then __simple-check__ was able to shrink the input down to `[42]`, as
seen in the keys `[:shrunk :smallest]`.

### `clojure.test` Integration

There is a macro called `defspec` that allows you to succinctly write
properties that run under the `clojure.test` runner, for example:

```clojure
(defspec first-element-is-min-after-sorting ;; the name of the test
         100 ;; the number of iterations for simple-check to test
         (prop/for-all [v (such-that not-empty (gen/vector gen/int))]
           (= (apply min v)
              (first (sorted v)))))
```
